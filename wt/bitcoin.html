<p>Coinfloor Launches Physical Bitcoin Futures
<q>Our mission is to build a bridge between Fiat currency and cryptocurrency,</q> Obi Nwosu, CEO of Coinfloor stressed, <q>to drive the stability and sustainability of cryptocurrency. Numerous market participants are calling on existing cryptocurrency exchanges that provide futures contracts to switch from cash to physical settlement. However, making that transition will be very difficult for them to achieve. We understood this requirement from the start, and have worked for over two years to bring this functionality to market. Now, institutional investors and traders can capitalise on market dynamics, within their own risk parameters and in line with their individual trading strategies.</q></p>

<p>As such, Coinfloor claims to have launched the <q>first physically delivered cryptocurrency futures contract</q> through its newly created crypto exchange, Coinfloorex. The contracts were <q>created to protect investors and traders against price slippage on positions at time of settlement, as well as concerns of market manipulation.</q></p>
